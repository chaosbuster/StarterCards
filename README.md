# StarterCards
WHAT:  A collection of Starter Cards for Makers in Spaces to get started with an activity

TARGET:  Originally targeted for Middle School ages

OBJECTIVES:  

1) These were created with the intent to share as a Creative Commons. If you see something on a Starter Card that would infringe on a copywright please submit a comment so I can make the necessary change(s) to keep it as a Creative Commons. 

2) There are many schools, libraries and community groups wanting to provide maker activities and these are intended to help them start with different makerspace areas on a rotation through their program year.  

3) As I create the content in these Starter Cards, the intent is to encourage life-long learning and discovering how to do different making activities, NOT to give a step by step of different projects.  Makers should be creative, problem-solvers and troubleshooters...don't give them too much structure or they will not learn from their mistakes.

4) As I mentor teachers, libraries and community organizers on starting a makerspace, I can't emphasize it more to 'Be the Facilitator to Learning' you don't have to be the expert or know how to do everything.  Have the encouragement ready, but don't always jump at doing the task for the maker.  Every individual's learning is in the journey, struggles, failures and successes!

If you like these Starter Cards and / or have suggestions, please feel free to comment or send us an email at jeanette@techno-chaos.com.

Enjoy the journey with your community of makers!
